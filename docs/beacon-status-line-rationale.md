# Beacon coordination status line — rationale

## Theory

Coordination surfaces must **never show an empty status**. Readers should instantly sense *what the situation is waiting for* without inferring from scattered cues.

### Harrison C. White — ambiguity vs ambage

| Concept | Meaning | Row that kills it |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Ambiguity** | Unclear what the shared situation *means* | **STATUS** — identical phase verb for every viewer in a visibility tier |
| **Ambage** | Unclear *who* should act | **YOU** — personal obligation counts / blocked segment |

**STATUS is never personalized and never imperative.**

### Latane & Darley — diffusion of responsibility

Readers move through: **notice → interpret → assume responsibility → know what to do → act**.

| Row | Audience | Role |
|-----|----------|------|
| **STATUS** | identical per tier | Shared phase + slot2 cue |
| **NOW** | identical | Author broadcast + blocker title subline |
| **YOU** | reader only | Personal obligation |
| **ACT** | reader only | One primary CTA (gated by capability) |

Avoid copy that points responsibility at everyone (e.g. “group's move”) — it recreates diffusion. Blocked STATUS uses **“clearing needed”**, not the blocker title.

## Clean Architecture layer map

```
UI adapters (thin)
  beacon_anchor_status, my_work_status_line, inbox_item_tile
       ↓ PhaseInput assembly
Presenters
  beacon_phase_presenter — l10n + TenturaTone only
       ↓
Domain
  deriveBeaconCoordinationPhase — priority ladder, rowHarmony, tiers
  OpenBlockerCue, beaconHasUnreviewedOffers
       ↓
Data / Server
  InboxRoomContextBatch — blocker raiser fields (no UI strings)
```

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| `dep-inward-only` | `lib/domain/**` — no Flutter, l10n, features, ui |
| `adapt-presenter-formats` | All status strings in `beacon_phase_presenter.dart` |
| `adapt-controller-thin` | Adapters: build input → derive → format → widget |

## Phase ladder (coordination tier)

| Priority | Phase | Slot2 | Trigger |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | blocked | clearing needed | open + open blocker |
| 2 | wrappingUp | review countdown | reviewOpen |
| 3 | needsMoreHelp | freshness | coordinationStatus = more help |
| 4 | enoughHelpInMotion | freshness | coordinationStatus = enough |
| 5 | offersAwaitingAuthor | author's move | unreviewed offers |
| 6 | coordinating | freshness | reviewed / room asks |
| 7 | lookingForHelpers | no offers yet | open + 0 offers |
| terminal | closed / cancelled | — | lifecycle |
| floor | draft / open | — | gap |

**Public tier** maps from `beacon.publicStatus` — never exposes `Offers awaiting author`.

---

## Anti-redundancy (`BeaconPhaseRowHarmony`)

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `suppressNowPlaceholder` | NOW row skips “no current line” placeholder |
| `suppressYouAwaitingAuthor` | YOU hides author-awaiting copy when STATUS already says offers awaiting author |
| `preferBlockedYouSegment` | YOU shows generic blocked segment when viewer is personally responsible |
| `showBlockedTitleInNowSubline` | Blocker title in NOW only, not STATUS |

Blocked YOU: generic copy + raiser avatar + elapsed time — **only when `responsibleUserId` matches viewer**.
