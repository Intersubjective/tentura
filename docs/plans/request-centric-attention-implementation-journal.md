## UNIT 01 — Product contract · ACCEPTED (2026-09-18)

**WHAT.** Wrote the durable product contract and wired it into the documentation index and glossary, so the
attention rules stop being re-derived from plan documents.

**FILES.** `docs/features/request-attention.md` (new, 244 lines); `docs/README.md` (feature row + active-plan
row, `new-stuff-indicators` row re-labelled as superseded); `CONTEXT.md` (§ My desk: obligation, optional update,
Dismiss all, outcome row — each with `_Avoid_`; responsibility-split entry now points at the contract);
`docs/features/new-stuff-indicators.md` (superseded banner); `docs/plans/work-activity-redesign-plan.md`
(refinement note naming what D1/D5/D7/D10 become).

**TESTS.** `bash scripts/check-user-facing-terminology.sh` → `check-user-facing-terminology: ok`. Relative links
from the new document resolved by hand: all five targets exist. No code touched, so no suite was run.

**FINDINGS.**
- `NewStuffCubit` no longer exists in the client, so `features/new-stuff-indicators.md` documented a retired
  mechanism — including "the active tab hides its navigation dot", which the new contract reverses. Banner added
  rather than deletion, to keep the history.
- The contract had to state its own status carefully: it describes both shipped and unshipped behaviour, so it
  says explicitly that a disagreement with code means either a defect or an unshipped feature, and the plan
  decides which.

**DECISIONS.** Recorded today's missing `×` on `helping` / `watching` outcome rows inside the contract as a known
defect rather than writing the rule as if it already held.

**REMAINING.** None for U01. Next: U02 characterization tests.

## Overseer session 1 — opened 2026-09-18

**Objective.** Units **U06a → U02 → U03** of
[`request-centric-attention-implementation-plan.md`](request-centric-attention-implementation-plan.md), then stop.
U04 and beyond are deliberately withheld until U02 reports the factual behaviour of the current projections.

**Repository.** `/home/vader/MY_SRC/tentura`, branch `feature/events_refac`, starting HEAD `d79ace257`
("docs: request-centric attention contract, plan and manifest").

**Baseline verified by the overseer before any worker started** (not a worker claim):
`dart test --tags pg -j 1 attention_activity_stream_pg_test.dart attention_surface_pg_test.dart
my_work_attention_pg_test.dart attention_retention_pg_test.dart` → **35 passed, 0 skipped, exit 0**, through
`scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh`. Postgres containers up and healthy, so PG targets are genuinely reachable —
any later "skipped" PG result is a **block**, never a pass.

**Pre-existing worktree state (must survive untouched).**
Modified: `.serena/project.yml`, `docs/plans/constellation-pin-badge-zoom-lod-implementation-journal.md`,
`packages/force_directed_graphview/analysis_options.yaml`, `packages/force_directed_graphview/pubspec.lock`.
Untracked: ~40 files including many `docs/plans/*.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `product_testing_*.md`, and the
secrets `key.fb`, `leo.key`, `out.key`, `dart-defines` — **no commit may contain these**.

**Environment.** `cursor-agent` 2026.09.15 with `composer-2.5` available (non-fast). MemAvailable 23.8 GB at start.

**Unit checklist for this session.**

| Unit | Status |
|---|---|
| U06a retention defect | worker 1 dispatched |
| U02 characterization tests | pending |
| U03 exhaustive classification | pending |

**Unresolved decisions/blockers.** None at open.

## UNIT U06a — Retention defect · COMPLETE (2026-09-18)

**WHAT.** `deleteSettledOlderThan` no longer deletes live obligations (`requires_action = true`,
`settlement_kind IS NULL`) that are merely old, seen, and emailed. Added a PG test that reproduces the defect.

**FILES.**
- `packages/server/lib/data/repository/notification_outbox_repository.dart` — exclude live obligations in the
  retention DELETE predicate.
- `packages/server/test/data/repository/attention_retention_pg_test.dart` — new test
  *retains live obligations even when seen, emailed, and older than the retention window*.

**TESTS.**

Red before fix (new test only; repository unchanged):

```bash
cd packages/server && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 20m -- dart test --tags pg -j 1 \
  test/data/repository/attention_retention_pg_test.dart
```

→ `00:01 +1 -1` — *retains live obligations…* failed: `Expected: <0> Actual: <1>` on `deleted` (row was
deleted). Prior test passed. Exit 1.

After fix — retention file:

```bash
cd packages/server && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 20m -- dart test --tags pg -j 1 \
  test/data/repository/attention_retention_pg_test.dart
```

→ `00:02 +2: All tests passed!` Exit 0.

Attention regression:

```bash
cd packages/server && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 20m -- dart test --tags pg -j 1 \
  test/data/repository/attention_activity_stream_pg_test.dart \
  test/data/repository/attention_surface_pg_test.dart \
  test/data/repository/my_work_attention_pg_test.dart \
  test/data/repository/attention_retention_pg_test.dart
```

→ `00:12 +36: All tests passed!` (35 prior + 1 new). 0 skipped. Exit 0.

Lints:

```bash
./scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 10m -- ./scripts/check-custom-lints.sh packages/server
```

→ `tentura_lints: packages/server total: 0 (baseline: 0)` · `check-custom-lints: packages/server OK`. Exit 0.

**FINDINGS.**
- `notification_outbox.cleared_at` does not exist in the current schema (planned in U04). An “uncleared optional”
  sibling case cannot be expressed yet; retention still deletes old optional receipts that are seen and emailed.

**DECISIONS.** Guard retention with `NOT (requires_action = true AND settlement_kind IS NULL)` only; defer
optional-clear retention exemption until `cleared_at` lands in U04.

**REMAINING.** U04 should extend `deleteSettledOlderThan` to keep uncleared optional receipts
(`requires_action = false` and `cleared_at IS NULL` once the column exists).
