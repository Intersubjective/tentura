# AGENTS.md — Tentura

Cross-tool entry point for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.).
This is the always-on index; depth lives in the linked rules/docs — read them only when the trigger matches.

## Project shape

Pub workspace with three packages: `packages/client` (Flutter app, package
`tentura`), `packages/server` (Dart), `packages/tentura_lints` (custom analyzer
plugin). See `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `DEV_GUIDELINES.md`.

## Invariants (always true; most are lint-enforced)

- **Dependency direction is inward:** domain stays pure; data implements domain ports; ui → domain/data. (lints: `no_domain_to_data_or_ui_import`, `no_cubit_to_data_service_import`)
- **Repositories return domain entities**, never Ferry/Drift types. Cubits coordinating ≥2 repos inject a `*Case`. (lint: `cubit_requires_use_case_for_multi_repos`)
- **Client UI uses the design system:** no raw `Color`/`Colors.*`, `TextStyle(…)`, inline `fontSize:`, or `EdgeInsets`/`BorderRadius` from raw numbers in `features/**` / `ui/**`; use `context.tt` tokens and `TenturaText.*`. (lints: `no_inline_font_size`, `no_operational_raw_color`, `no_raw_edge_insets`, `no_raw_border_radius`)
- **Never edit generated files** (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `*.gr.dart`, `*.config.dart`, `*.schema.dart`); run codegen instead.
- **Search ladder:** known path → Read; semantic → Serena MCP; then Grep/Glob.
- **Terminology alias:** user-facing **Request** / **discussion** (workspace), **Activity** / «Активность» (home nav branch; `Activity (internally: inbox)` in docs), **thread** / **General** (one conversation); internal **Beacon** (`Request (internally: Beacon)` in docs). Never introduce a `Request` domain entity. See `.cursor/rules/terminology.mdc` and `bash scripts/check-user-facing-terminology.sh`.
- **Client versioning + gate:** user-visible client changes require a semver bump in `packages/client/pubspec.yaml`; when a release forces clients to update, raise `kDefaultMinClientVersion` in `packages/server/lib/env.dart` (see `.cursor/rules/versioning.mdc` and `DEV_GUIDELINES.md` § Client version gate).
- **Web cache-buster must ship with every client version bump:** `packages/client/web/index.html`'s `flutter_bootstrap.js?v=<version>` query is a real, git-tracked source file (unlike `web/manifest.json`, which is deliberately `skip-worktree` and never needs committing) — it only gets rewritten to match `pubspec.yaml` when you actually run/build the app locally (`flutter run`/`flutter build web`; the `hook/build.dart` build hook does it, not `build_runner`). Before committing a version bump, run the app once and check `git status` for a resulting `web/index.html` diff, or hand-verify the `?v=` matches. A missed bump here means browsers keep serving a cached pre-fix JS bundle after a real fix ships — this has happened before (`git log -- packages/client/web/index.html` shows recurring catch-up `chore: sync web cache-buster` commits) and once made a landed bug fix look like it "didn't work."

## Product docs

Orientation and feature specs live under [`docs/`](docs/) — start at [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). High-signal: [`docs/Tentura_current_status_quo.md`](docs/Tentura_current_status_quo.md), [`docs/features/beacon_room.md`](docs/features/beacon_room.md).

## Verify

Local/agent test runs **must** go through `scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh`.
It time-bounds the command, SIGKILLs hung descendants, and deletes
unreferenced `/tmp/flutter_tools.*` + `/tmp/dart_test.kernel.*` (those live
on a RAM tmpfs). CI does **not** use it (ephemeral runners). Do not wrap
`flutter run` or `scripts/run_client_integration_web_local.sh`.

```bash
# sweep leftovers from a killed agent, no new tests
./scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --sweep-only

cd packages/tentura_lints && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 10m -- dart test
./scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 10m -- ./scripts/check-custom-lints.sh packages/client
./scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 10m -- ./scripts/check-custom-lints.sh packages/server
cd packages/client && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 45m -- \
  flutter test --dart-define=ENV=test --dart-define-from-file=env/test.env
cd packages/client && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 20m -- \
  flutter test --update-goldens <path>   # regenerate a golden intentionally
cd packages/server && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 20m -- \
  dart test --exclude-tags pg
# Postgres tests run in two steps. The `mr` ones also reach the MeritRank
# service, which is a single shared container every disposable database talks
# to, so they must not run in parallel with each other.
cd packages/server && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 30m -- \
  dart test --tags pg --exclude-tags mr
cd packages/server && ../../scripts/run_with_test_cleanup.sh --timeout 30m -- \
  dart test --tags mr -j 1
```

> Disposable pg databases are cloned from a prebuilt template
> (`tentura_test_tpl_<registry-hash>`, see `test/support/disposable_pg_target.dart`)
> rather than migrated one by one — `migrateDbSchema` holds a **cluster-wide**
> advisory lock, and 95 test files serializing on it for a full schema build was
> the main source of load-dependent failures. The template rebuilds itself when
> the migration registry changes. Stale `tentura_test_*` databases accumulate and
> slow every `CREATE DATABASE`; drop them if a suite run looks unusually slow.
>
> Never query `pg_locks` or `pg_stat_activity` from a test without scoping to
> `current_database()` (or `datname = <own database>`): they report the whole
> cluster, and another database's schema upgrade will satisfy an unqualified
> predicate. See `test/support/pg_wait.dart` for the wait-budget rule.

Never start a bare `flutter test` / `dart test` / `dart analyze` in the
background. Default suite timeout is 45m (`--timeout`); override shorter
for a single file. Wrapper self-check: `bash scripts/run_with_test_cleanup_selftest.sh`.

> Do **not** use `flutter analyze` to check `tentura_lints` rules — it does not load analyzer
> plugins and always reports them clean. Nor `dart analyze <subdir>`: plugin diagnostics only
> surface when the target is the package root. Nor Dart MCP `analyze_files`: it spawns a
> second language-server and can freeze the machine; use `ReadLints` plus
> `scripts/check-custom-lints.sh`. That script invokes the analyzer correctly and ratchets
> the count against `scripts/custom-lint-baseline.txt`.

CI (`.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`) runs the lint tests, `scripts/check-custom-lints.sh` for
both packages, `bash scripts/check-user-facing-terminology.sh`, and `flutter test` on every push
to `main`.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Standard dev setup is in `DEVELOPMENT.md` and the `local-debug` skill; only the non-obvious cloud caveats are below. Flutter 3.44 lives at `/opt/flutter/bin` (on `PATH` via `~/.bashrc`). Docker, Caddy, and `jq` are pre-installed in the snapshot. The startup update script only runs `flutter pub get`; everything else (Docker daemon, infra, servers) must be started manually.

**Fast bring-up:** `sudo service docker start`, then `./scripts/dev-up.sh` (bootstraps `.env` with a real JWT keypair, starts infra, applies Hasura metadata), then run the three foreground processes it prints (server, `run-flutter-web-local.sh`, Caddy).

- **Generated code + `.env` persist in the snapshot, not git.** `*.g.dart`/`*.gr.dart`/`*.config.dart`/l10n and repo-root `.env` are git-ignored but were generated/created during setup and live in the snapshot. Re-run codegen only after changing GraphQL/Freezed/Drift/AutoRoute/Injectable/`.arb`: `cd packages/client && flutter gen-l10n && dart run build_runner build -d` (and `dart run build_runner build -d` in `packages/server`).
- **Start Docker before infra:** `sudo service docker start` (daemon does not auto-start). Docker 29 uses `fuse-overlayfs` with `containerd-snapshotter` disabled (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`).
- **Server rejects the placeholder JWT keys.** Under `ENVIRONMENT=dev/prod`, `Env._assertJwtKeys` refuses the `.env.example` keys. Generate a real dev keypair with `./scripts/gen-dev-jwt.sh` (or `./scripts/dev-up.sh`); after rotating keys, recreate Hasura (`docker compose up -d --force-recreate hasura`) so `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` matches, else Hasura returns `invalid-jwt`.
- **QA login needs `ENVIRONMENT=dev`** (set by `dev-up.sh` / `.env.example`) plus `QA_SIMPLE_LOGIN_MODE=true` + `QA_AUTH_ENABLED=true`; QA routes 404 under the default `prod`. `access-token` is a **POST** to `/api/v2/session/access-token` and returns `access_token` (snake_case).
- **Hasura metadata must be applied** or the app shows `field 'beacon'/'invitation' not found in type: 'query_root'` on My Work / My people. `dev-up.sh` does this; standalone: `./scripts/hasura_apply_metadata.sh`.
- **Flutter web binds IPv4 via `run-flutter-web-local.sh`** (`--web-hostname=127.0.0.1`, overridable with `LOCAL_FLUTTER_HOSTNAME`). Without that it binds `::1`, which `Caddyfile.local`'s `127.0.0.1:8888` upstream can't reach → 502 on app paths.
- **Caddy needs sudo and a trusted CA for the Chrome/computerUse browser:** `sudo caddy run --config Caddyfile.local`. The Caddy local root CA is installed into the system store and the user NSS DB (`~/.pki/nssdb`) so `https://dev.lvh.me:9443` is trusted; `dev.lvh.me` is mapped to `127.0.0.1` in `/etc/hosts`.
- **UI text entry:** the Flutter web app uses CanvasKit, so DOM typing does not reach the framework — set up state via the v2 API (e.g. `beaconCreate`) and use the UI to view it (see `local-debug` skill). The landing page (`/`, plain HTML) accepts typing, so the QA "Test login" form there works (enabled via `packages/landing/config.local.js` `qaTestLogin: true`).

## Headroom Learned Patterns
*Auto-generated by `headroom learn` on 2026-08-23 — do not edit manually*

### Local dev server port checks
*~52,001 tokens/session saved*
- Before running `flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8888 ...` or `./scripts/run-flutter-web-local.sh`, check whether port 8888 is already bound (`ss -ltnp | rg ':8888'` or `lsof -iTCP:8888 -sTCP:LISTEN`) — re-invoking the dev server against an already-running instance was repeated 85x in one session for ~52k wasted tokens.

### dev.tentura.io deploy proxy quirk
*~30,168 tokens/session saved*
- The prod/dev proxy (Caddy on dev.tentura.io) is sensitive to `server block without any key must be first` ordering and APP_HOST env wiring; TLS errors from `curl` against it after a Caddyfile edit usually mean the server block order broke, not a network issue — check Caddyfile block order before re-testing TLS repeatedly.

### GitHub Actions workflow validation (no gh/ruby/yq locally)
*~21,976 tokens/session saved*
- `gh`, `ruby`, and `yq` are not installed locally — don't try them for `.github/workflows/*.yml` work.
- Validate YAML syntax with `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/pipeline.yml'))"`, and lint semantics with `docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/repo -w /repo rhysd/actionlint:latest .github/workflows/pipeline.yml`.
